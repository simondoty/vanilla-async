Instructions for running the two task functions

1) extract zipped files
2) run 'npm install' in the root
3) run 'npm index.js' to run the two functions

Note:
Unfortunately the script does not accept arguments or passed in values.
Obviously this isn't ideal. If you wish to experiment with different inputs,
they can easily be added to the index.js file before the two lib functions are called.
Sorry for any inconvenience on that.
